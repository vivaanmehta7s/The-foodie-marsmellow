    <h1>The Foodie Marshmallow</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>The Foodie Marshmallow</strong> is a student-initiated project developed by students of
      <strong>The Shri Ram School – Aravali, Gurugram, India</strong>. What began as a simple idea gradually
      evolved into a creative and engaging concept that reflects innovation, curiosity, and collaborative learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      The company website was designed and developed by one of the co-founders, along with an associated
      game created by the student <strong>Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</strong>. This project highlights the
      students’ strong interest in technology, creativity, and problem-solving through digital design and development.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Foodie Marshmallow</strong> represents our commitment to learning through creation, and we
      hope it is received as an example of student effort, imagination, and technical growth.
