    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The Foodie Marshmallow is a student-initiated project developed by students of
      The Shri Ram School – Aravali, Gurugram, India. What began as a simple idea gradually
      evolved into a creative and engaging concept that reflects innovation, curiosity,
      and collaborative learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform used for this company website was designed and developed by one of the
      co-founders, along with an associated game created by the student Chief Technology
      Officer (CTO). The project highlights the students’ strong interest in technology,
      creativity, and problem-solving through digital design.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Foodie Marshmallow represents our commitment to learning through creation, and we
      hope it is received as an example of student effort, imagination, and technical growth.
